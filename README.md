# IdeaTrackr
An Android app to track ideas as you go

Currently able to create, edit, and delete your own ideas. You can also login with your Google account.
More recently I've been messing around with some Google APIs trying to sync the ideas using Google Drive and/or Sheets.

The UI is pretty basic right now, as I'm focusing on functionality. I'll try to make it nicer looking once I get the
Google sync going.
