# IdeaTrackr
An Android app to track ideas on the go

Currently able to create, edit, and delete your own ideas. You can also login with your Google account and have the option to backup your ideas into Google Drive.

The UI is pretty basic right now.

Potential Enhancements:
- Improve Drive integration (Will probably have to migrate to the Drive REST API; currently using the Drive API for Android, which is very limited)
    - Share ideas with a friend on Drive
    - Provide a sync option where the ideas in the app are updated based on a file in Drive
        - This could be used to have multiple "lists" of ideas, depending on which one you load (ex. one for yourself, one for your team that's working on a project)
- Improve the terrible UI
